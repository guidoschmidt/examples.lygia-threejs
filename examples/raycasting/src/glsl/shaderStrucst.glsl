// Note that a struct cannot be used for the hit record including faceIndices, faceNormal, barycoord,
// side, and dist because on some mobile GPUS (such as Adreno) numbers are afforded less precision specifically
// when in a struct leading to inaccurate hit results. See KhronosGroup/WebGL#3351 for more details.

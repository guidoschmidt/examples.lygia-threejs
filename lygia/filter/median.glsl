description: 3x3 and 5x5 median filter, adapted from "A Fast, Small-Radius GPU Median Filter" by Morgan McGuire in ShaderX6 https://casual-effects.com/research/McGuire2008Median/index.html
use: median(<SAMPLER_TYPE> texture, <vec2> st, <vec2> pixel)
options:
    - MEDIAN_AMOUNT: median3 (3x3) median5 (5x5)
    - MEDIAN_TYPE: default vec4
    - MEDIAN_SAMPLER_FNC(TEX, UV): default texture2D(TEX, UV)
    - SAMPLER_FNC(TEX, UV): optional depending the target version of GLSL (texture2D(...) or texture(...))
